# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
-My program is a no-input weather finder. When the program is run the program finds your IP(Geoplugin API), from this info the program gets the weather(open-meteo API), and then prints the weather with an added emoji(EmojiHub API) based on the temperature.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
 
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
-the project finds machine IP, but since Replit is a virtual machine it states its location is wherever the website is being hosted(I have gotten South Carolina, Iowa, and Oregon). Thus the weather output will be from that location unless run locally.

-must have pyfiglet module downloaded on your local machine for the ASCII text to print properly.
