# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION: I created a flower and stem drawing with a vibrant yellow sun. The flower is set at 9 petals but will create an even flower with any number of petals. 
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS: NONE

## REFERENCES: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS: I really recommend playing with the "sides" variable, it is really fun to watch the turtle make the flower with differnt numbers of petals
